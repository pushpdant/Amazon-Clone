Amazon Clone

Here is a description for an Amazon clone project with HTML and CSS:

This project was a great way to learn HTML and CSS while creating a familiar and engaging website. 
By recreating the main elements of the Amazon homepage, such as the navigation bar, search bar, hero section, cards, and footer, I  gain a solid understanding of how these components come together to create an attractive website. 
Throughout the project, I also explore different HTML tags and CSS properties that will help you efficiently create your Amazon-inspired homepage.
